## 2024-11-24
- Bootstrapped the client-only MoodCanvas application shell with Tailwind Play CDN and dark Plum–Peach theme.
- Implemented local BYOK handling, IndexedDB project store, and sequential chat-like timeline for the room design workflow.
- Added prompt builders, Gemini client integration scaffolding, and unit tests covering prompt generation utilities.
- Persisted project media/artifacts locally and wired gallery, A/B, and hero render cards with concurrency scaffolding.

- Fixed Gemini client fetch invocation to run within the browser global context, resolving the "Illegal invocation" runtime error when running analysis.
- Added a unit test ensuring the client binds the fetch implementation correctly to prevent regressions.
- Sanitized the analysis response schema to match Gemini's structured output format and added regression tests to block unsupported keywords.
